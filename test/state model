Observe that the states in typical models talk about
 | booleans    integers   vectors     records   caches 
 | bits        symbols    arrays      stacks    files 
 | characters  strings    sequences   tables    directories 

These objects are discrete rather than continuous; furthermore they are built incrementally or inductively by repeatedly using primitive operations to put together smaller pieces.

The functions we need to manipulate these objects do things like concatenate, reverse, sort, search, count, etc.
