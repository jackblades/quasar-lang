- using categories as the basic primitive
- using data-structures as the basic primitive

- stack-based evaluation -- tree (call functions)
- queue-based evaluation -- graph? (pop message -> process)
-- or is it actually depth-first vs breadth-first?


- purely functional -- expressions
- stateful objects -- smalltalk?

-- compile to categories?

- stack is single-threaded
- graph is multi-threaded?
